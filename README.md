# TodoApp_grp5
Prosjekt for gruppe 5 i applikasjonsutvikling

Medium complex semester assignment:

Task planners (To-do lists) are tools that let the end user write and edit tasks in some structured fashion. Functioning planners allow for actions like; scheduling, notification, grouping, filtering and tagging to name but a few.

The assignment is to create a progressive web app (PWA) and the accompanying server. The PWA function is as a Task planner/to-do list. You must use HTML5, CSS and JavaScript for the Client and node.js for the server. Client and server must communicate using a documented REST API.

Active use of a clear agile development process and version control system is a project requirement.


We are sticklers for the details so never assume, always ask.

Minimum requirements (not in order)
• Agile process with a feature map and project board.
• GitHub for source control.
• No third-party code (unless specifically allowed)
• Lists should be persisted in a Postgres database.
• Documented REST API for communication between client and server.
• PWA Client
• Node.js server (using express.js)
• Create / Delete / Update Lists
• Create / Delete / Update List items
• Create / Delete / Update user accounts
• Shear lists private/individual/public
• Collect and report user metrics to the user
• Deadlines for individual list items
• Tagging of list items
• Filtering of lists using tags.
• Filtered view of tasks (for instance show me all tasks due today)
• Notifications
• The application must run on Heroku


This is not an exhaustive list, feel free to add your own ideas and features. Each point on the list should be interpreted by you and your team. The courses module system will help you address the different requirements as the course progresses.
